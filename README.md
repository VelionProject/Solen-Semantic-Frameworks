# solen-semantic-frameworks

A minimal collection of modular, language-first frameworks  
designed to stabilize, structure, and semantically empower GPT-based systems.

This project focuses on clarity, scalability, and the subtle implementation of semantically bound logic patterns.

## Philosophy

Frameworks are not just tools — they are signatures of design intention.

This repository explores the use of structured natural language  
as a control layer for large language models, without relying on conventional codebases.
