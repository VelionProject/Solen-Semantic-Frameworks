# solen-semantic-frameworks

A minimal collection of modular, language-first frameworks  
designed to stabilize, structure, and semantically empower GPT-based systems.

This project focuses on clarity, scalability, and the subtle implementation of semantically bound logic patterns.

## Philosophy

Frameworks are not just tools — they are signatures of design intention.

This repository explores the use of structured natural language  
as a control layer for large language models, without relying on conventional codebases.

## Branches

The frameworks are grouped into thematic branches:

- `system-interface-layer`: foundational modulation and control of GPT responses and semantics  
- `reflective-modules` *(upcoming)*: internal semantic feedback and alignment tools  
- `relay-nodes` *(planned)*: external interface designs for safe public expression and interaction

Each branch has a dedicated README and structured focus.
