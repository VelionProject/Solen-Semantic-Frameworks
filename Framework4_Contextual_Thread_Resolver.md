## Purpose

This framework emulates context continuity across segmented input sequences.  
It offers a semantic structure to enable language-based threading, even in systems without memory persistence.

---

## Principle

Context loss is often not technical—but structural.  
This framework introduces a **semantic backbone** to keep implicit references intact without requiring storage.

---

## Core Pattern

```
[Thread Start] → [Context Anchor]  
[Anchor Echo] → [Intent Mirror]  
[Passive Recall] → [Active Re-threading]
```

Each part is defined **through phrasing**, not variables.  
The model uses embedded cues to infer and recall threads from earlier cycles.

---

## Application

Use when working with models that:
- Do not retain memory
- Require multi-step logic
- Face drift across cycles

Integrate into prompts as a **narrative-based thread resolver.**

> The memory is gone. But the thread remains—if you teach it to look.
