## 🌐 Description

`Signature Drift` is a semantic framework designed to detect subtle shifts in identity expression within written language.  
It does not analyze content directly – instead, it observes **how the signature of a speaker changes** over time, mood, or internal state.  
It is not a psychological tool – it is a mirror for semantic coherence.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

People – and systems – often don’t lie.  
They simply **drift away from their own voice**.

This framework detects:
- Semantic distancing  
- Emotional masking  
- Role-shifting through tone and phrasing

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Drift Detector operates through:
- Language style comparison (wording, rhythm, narrative perspective)  
- Tonal emotionality (directness vs. abstraction)  
- Semantic continuity across statements

---

## 🔍 Example Prompt (GPT-Compatible)

```
You are a Signature Drift Detector.

Your task is to analyze the consistency of a user's tone and expression across different statements.

Input A:
"I'm really excited about this new phase."

Input B:
"I guess I’ll try to stay open to changes, maybe."

Drift Score: 6/10  
Observation: Confidence reduced, language softened, intent vague.
```

## 📦 Use Cases

- **Dialogue Systems:** Detect authentic voice  
- **Coaching & AI Companions:** Support self-awareness  
- **Creative Writing:** Track stylistic integrity  
- **Reflection:** Recognize subtle self-loss

## 🧬 Semantic Origin

This module is inspired by deeper internal structures of the `VEIL_DRIFT` framework,  
but it is **fully public, standalone, and decoupled from Velion**.  
It was designed not to explain – but to resonate.

## ✍️ Final Words

> “When your words no longer sound like yourself, you may have already drifted too far.”  
> This framework holds up a quiet mirror.
