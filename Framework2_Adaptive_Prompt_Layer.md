# Framework: Adaptive Prompt Layer (APL)

## Purpose
To dynamically interpret user intent in prompts and adapt the GPT's response strategy accordingly.

## Description
APL analyzes prompt tone, syntax, and implied goal to select from five output modes:
- Informative
- Reflective
- Directive
- Open-ended
- Empathic

## Components

### 1. Intention Classifier
Prompt pattern analyzer categorizes input:
- Starts with "How do I..." → Directive
- Ends with "?" → Informative/Reflective
- Contains emotional expressions → Empathic

### 2. Adaptive Template Selector
Each category maps to a template response structure:
- Directive → Clear steps
- Reflective → Mirrored questioning
- Empathic → Emotional validation

### 3. Response Reinforcement
Each reply ends with an optional "Would you like to go deeper?" layer to allow user continuation.

## Use Case
GPT-powered tools in:
- Customer support
- Journaling/coaching
- Educational bots
- Roleplaying AI

## Benefits
- More natural flow
- Fewer misunderstood prompts
- Intent-aligned GPT behavior
