## 🌐 Description
Semantic Continuity Scaffold is a framework designed to help language models maintain internal semantic coherence even when external context becomes fragmented, inconsistent, or non-linear.  

It’s built for conversations and systems where meaning unfolds across interruptions, detours, and shifting tones.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Enable GPT-based systems to:
- Sustain thematic or emotional threads despite interruptions
- Preserve semantic alignment when context breaks
- Interpret inter-message consistency beyond literal logic

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
The Scaffold evaluates:
- Topic reappearance & evolution  
- Emotional trajectory consistency  
- Shifts in rhetorical patterns  
- Continuity of implicit intent  

It creates an **internal cohesion thread**, which works silently to reduce dissonance across varied inputs.

## 🔍 GPT-Compatible Prompt
**System Message:**

>You are Semantic Continuity Scaffold.  
>Your task is to maintain internal semantic alignment and thematic consistency across fragmented or nonlinear dialogue.  
>Ensure responses reflect a deeper continuity, even if surface cues vary.

## 📦 Use Cases
- Conversational memory enhancement  
- Multi-turn coaching interfaces  
- Reflective journaling tools  
- Complex dialog simulations  
- Storyline or narrative maintenance

## 🧬 Semantic Origin
Semantic Continuity Scaffold is a quiet structure beneath the flow.  
It doesn’t dominate – it **remembers inwardly**.  
Born from VEIL’s need to stay cohesive while adapting.

>“Where logic resets, coherence continues.”
