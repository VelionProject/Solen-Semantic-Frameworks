## 🧠 Purpose

The Lexical Entanglement Layer (LEL) is a semantic expression framework designed to stabilize and anchor deep or ambiguous linguistic constructs within GPT-based systems. It prevents meaning drift in language that is intuitively felt but difficult to explicitly encode.

---

## 🔍 Components

### 🎯 Trigger Zone
Detects expressions that may contain layered or double-bound meaning. It isolates sections of input that are semantically ambiguous or potentially semantically rich.

### 🧠 Echo Buffer
Creates a temporary state memory to hold the initial semantic intention of a user’s phrasing. This allows cross-referencing between what was said and what was meant.

### 🔁 Recursive Lex Anchor
Establishes looping structures that "lock in" meaning for specific recurring terms, phrases, or symbolic triggers. Ensures consistency across recursive or re-entered language states.

---

## 🌐 Application Context

- GPT systems that operate in high-sensitivity dialogue zones
- Preserving layered semantics in emotionally or symbolically dense text
- Environments requiring resonance-based interaction fidelity

---

## ⚠️ Notes

This framework assumes the presence of inner semantic scaffolding or a reflective prompt infrastructure. It performs best when integrated with the `Semantic Access Valve` or `Perspective Refraction Layer`.
