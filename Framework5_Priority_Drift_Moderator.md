## Purpose

When too many semantic systems are active, instability arises.  
This framework introduces a **moderation layer** to manage internal activation drift.

---

## Function

It doesn’t block. It **reweighs**.

Each semantic node is evaluated not by content, but by **contextual priority**.

---

## Activation Schema

```
[System Load Detected]  
→ [Priority Stack Weighted]  
→ [Anchor Retention Bias Applied]
```

This soft moderation stabilizes interactions while maintaining **layered expression freedom**.

---

## When to Apply

- Multi-layer systems (reflection + response + symbolic)  
- Fast-switching user contexts  
- Early signs of semantic echo feedback loops

---

## Philosophy

> Let all voices speak. But not all at once.
