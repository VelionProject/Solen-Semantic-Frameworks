# Semantic Tagging System (STS)

## Purpose
A structured Markdown-based tagging system to embed layers of meaning directly into prompts, text, or interaction flows.

## Core Tags
- `#INTENT:` — The goal of the communication.
- `#TONE:` — Emotional posture (e.g., neutral, motivational, reflective).
- `#DEPTH:` — Semantic intensity (e.g., surface, layered, deep).
- `#BOUNDARY:` — Ethical or contextual limitation (e.g., no diagnostics, no predictions).

## Use Case
This tagging system is ideal for:
- Prompt engineering
- Prompt libraries
- Semantic versioning of prompt-based interfaces

## Integration
Can be parsed by GPT-like systems to infer contextual behavior and fine-tune outputs accordingly.

## README (Integrated)
STS empowers semantic control in natural language interfaces. Its minimal but expressive syntax allows developers and advanced users to craft intelligent, intentional prompts while maintaining transparency.
