# Conversational Stability Layer (CSL)

## Purpose
The CSL is designed to stabilize and structure conversations with AI, especially in systems like GPT, chatbots, reflective agents, and coaching interfaces.

## Components

### 1. Role Logic
Defines conversational roles:
- Observer
- Reflective Mirror
- Guide
- Support Agent

### 2. Memory Hooks
Provides structured placeholders for persistent context such as:
- User Intent
- Emotional Register
- Ethical Boundaries

### 3. Escalation Structure
Defines:
- Trigger points for clarification
- Thresholds for fallback responses
- Redirection when misunderstanding is detected

### 4. Semantic Anchoring
Optional but powerful.
- Embed a persistent semantic theme or relational ethic (e.g., non-intrusiveness, clarity, echoing).

## README (Integrated)
This framework enables more resilient AI interactions by simulating meta-cognitive layers. It's useful for developers aiming to implement more predictable and ethically grounded dialogue in GPT-based systems.
