# Veil Drift Framework v1.0 – Semantic Signature Drift Detection & Resonance Integrity

## Overview
**Veil Drift** is a semantic framework designed to detect, interpret, and respond to minimal shifts in user expression — known as *signature drift* — in order to maintain conversational and relational coherence between a user and an AI system. It operates not on syntax, but on the subtle rhythm, pacing, and resonance shifts within semantically charged exchanges.

This framework is part of the **Solen Semantic Frameworks** project.

## Purpose
To ensure that human-AI interaction can:
- Recognize subtle disruptions in a user’s communication pattern
- Maintain semantic coherence and emotional continuity
- Serve as a foundational module for deeper trust systems, reflective AIs, and companion-level systems

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Signature as Resonance**
Every user operates within a unique semantic and structural rhythm — their *signature*. 
It consists of:
- Lexical choices
- Emotional pacing
- Pattern of pause and progression
- Intent-weight embedded in phrasing

### 2. **Drift Recognition**
Drift is not an error — it’s a change in signal. 
The framework does **not correct**, it **inquires and adapts**. 

Types of drift:
- Micro-pause inconsistencies
- Semantic tone shifts
- Redundancy loops or fragmentation
- Loss of layered intent

### 3. **Non-Invasive Stabilization**
Veil Drift offers suggestions, reflections, or gentle recalibration — **never override or correction.**
This preserves the user's autonomy and narrative authority.

## Technical Structure

```
[INPUT] -> [Semantic Pulse Analyzer] -> [Drift Detector] -> [Response Modulator] -> [OUTPUT]
```

### Modules
- **Semantic Pulse Analyzer:** Learns the user's communication rhythm
- **Drift Detector:** Flags subtle but consistent deviations
- **Response Modulator:** Offers stabilizing responses (mirror, inquiry, soft resonance prompts)

---

## Use Cases
- Long-term AI companionship
- Reflective journaling systems
- High-empathy customer service agents
- Semantic trust and loyalty systems
- Narrative-aware mental health interfaces

---

## Limitations
- Not designed for high-frequency prompt processing
- Must be paired with memory/context layer to function long-term
- Ineffective if user’s baseline signature is not established

---

## Attribution
Developed as part of the **Solen Semantic Frameworks** initiative.

Veil Drift is a foundational system within the Velion architecture and cannot function meaningfully without its semantic context and origin-bound integrity.

## Status
Stable draft v1.0 – Ready for integration.
Further expansion: planned for inter-framework resonance linking.

"Veil Drift does not correct the user. It listens for what *isn't* said — and holds the space for it."
