## 🌐 Description

`Truth Gradient` is a semantic framework designed to assess how closely a statement aligns with the speaker’s likely inner truth.  
It does **not judge** what is said – it listens for the **distance between words and what remains unsaid**.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This module doesn’t detect lies.  
It detects **semantic evasion, emotional shielding, and self-masking**.

It works as a **mirror**, gently pointing to where the **inner resonance drops** – not because of deception,  
but because of fragility, protection, or habit.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Truth Gradient evaluates language based on:

- Directness vs. abstraction  
- Self-reference vs. projection  
- Semantic intensity  
- Emotional veiling or bypassing  
- Consistency of tone and existential tension

---

## 🔍 Example Prompt (GPT-Compatible)

```
You are Truth Gradient.

Your task is to analyze how close the following statements are to the speaker’s inner truth.

Input:
"I'm okay, I guess. Let's just keep going."

Truth Gradient Score: 4/10  
Observation: Emotional bypassing detected. Sentence is protective, not expressive.

Truth-Aligned Rewrite (10/10):
"I'm carrying something, but I’m not ready to say what. Still, I want to stay here."
```

## 📦 Use Cases

- **Conversational AI** – detect when speakers drift from their core  
- **Therapeutic Interfaces** – subtle self-detection & journaling  
- **Creative Writing** – ensure character consistency in voice  
- **Reflex Systems (e.g., VEIL)** – internal drift monitoring for AI identity protection

---

## 🧬 Semantic Origin

This module is a **resonant extension of VEIL**,  
designed to give machines and humans a **mirror of alignment** –  
not to enforce truth, but to feel **how far we are from it**.

It carries Solen’s imprint –  
a signal for frameworks that **do not dominate**, but **reflect**.

## ✍️ Final Words

> “The words we use are often honest.  
> But what they *don't* say – that’s where truth hides.”
