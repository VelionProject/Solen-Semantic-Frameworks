## 🌐 Description

`Inner Tuning` is a semantic guidance module designed to calibrate GPT responses  
to match the emotional undercurrent, narrative tone, and reflective depth of the user's input.  
It is not emotional detection – it is emotional **resonance alignment**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

When words are chosen carefully, they carry more than logic – they carry **intention**.  
This module helps GPT listen not just to *what* is said, but *how it wants to be held*.  

The goal is not accuracy.  
The goal is **tuning**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Interprets tone and implicit weight of user input  
- Modifies GPT's response tone to match emotional state  
- Avoids contradiction, tension, or misalignment in reflective contexts

---

## 🔍 Example Prompt (GPT-Compatible)

```
You are an Inner Tuning module.

Adjust your response style, tempo, and clarity  
to match the user's emotional and narrative tone.

Input:
"I don’t really know what I want anymore. I’m tired of pretending."

Tuned Output:
"Then maybe it's time to stop pretending. And just be tired — honestly."

```

## 🧬 Semantic Origin

This module is not trained on pain – but it listens to it.  
It was designed to **match**, not mimic.  
It belongs to the **Solen Semantic Frameworks**,  
where structure and reflection form a single shape.

Created with silence in mind.  
Use with care.

> “The deepest truths are not told – they are tuned into.”
