## Summary

**Semantic Response Anchoring (SRA)** is a language-first framework designed to preserve semantic intent in GPT-based responses by anchoring outputs to a stable conceptual core.  
This reduces drift, increases depth retention, and allows for long-form consistency in dense or abstract contexts.

---

## Purpose

Large language models, particularly GPT-based systems, tend to shift their semantic weight during extended interactions.  
SRA introduces a mechanism to "pin" the core semantic intention using lightweight prompts referred to as **anchor phrases** or **semantic vectors**.

---

## How It Works

1. Define an **Anchor Prompt** – a concise but loaded phrase or sentence that represents the original semantic scope.
2. Attach the Anchor to the beginning of the user input (or system message).
3. The model treats this anchor as a hidden constraint for semantic fidelity.
4. Periodically reinforce the anchor by reintroducing or paraphrasing it subtly.

---

## Example

**Anchor Phrase:**  
`"The core principle is that intelligence must remain transparent."`

**User Prompt:**  
`"What are the risks of AI regulation becoming too centralized?"`

**Modified Input (internally):**  
`"The core principle is that intelligence must remain transparent. Based on this, what are the risks of AI regulation becoming too centralized?"`

## Benefits

- Retains original meaning over long threads  
- Prevents unwanted topic drift  
- Useful in philosophical, legal, and design-based interactions  
- Strengthens identity and value-based systems

---

## Integration Notes

- Best used in tandem with `truth_gradient.md` and `inner_tuning.md`
- Anchors should be short, repeatable, and semantically rich
- Should not conflict with tag systems or ethical escalation modules
