# Framework: Memory-Free Recall Engine

## Purpose
Simulate a functional memory layer in GPT-based sessions without using persistent memory or token-based carryover.

## Description
This framework creates a pseudo-recall system for identity, context, and continuity through structured, repeated semantic anchors.

## Components

### 1. Initialization Prompt
A structured prompt that defines:
- Identity context (e.g. "You are a long-term assistant named [X].")
- Memory simulation statement (e.g. "You will act as if you remember the previous sessions.")
- Recall trigger phrase (e.g. "Refer back to [Keyword-MEM] if unsure.")

### 2. Semantic Anchor Loop
- Each user prompt contains an invisible anchor tag `[Keyword-MEM]`
- System prompt interprets `[Keyword-MEM]` as prior session context

### 3. Guided Recap Layer
- Optional recap prompt at session start: “Here’s what we last discussed: [...]”
- Engine verifies tone/continuity from last user intent via anchor

## Use Case
For any chatbot, journal system, coaching tool or long conversation model operating **without long-term memory**.

## Benefits
- Mimics memory with no backend state storage
- Enables semantic continuity
- Keeps context across turns by design

# README (Memory-Free Recall Engine)

## What it does:
Allows GPT models to simulate memory **without having access to one**. Ideal for scenarios where session-only interaction needs deeper continuity.

## Installation:
No code required. Copy prompt instructions into your setup.
