## 🌐 Description  
Directive Translator is a semantic tool framework designed to convert vague, emotionally charged, or overly abstract user input into clear, directive prompts that GPT-based systems can execute efficiently.

This module increases prompt clarity, ensures goal alignment, and improves task execution – without coding.

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
This module is not a rephrasing tool.  
It is a **semantic clarity engine** that detects hidden intention, filters emotional noise, and re-centers communication on *actionable logic*.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
Directive Translator analyzes inputs based on:

- Verb structure and action weight  
- Hidden intention and implied outcome  
- Emotional qualifiers or conflict avoidance  
- Passive vs. active phrasing  
- Prompt ambiguity resolution

Then, it formulates a **clear, action-oriented directive** while preserving the speaker’s core intent.

## 🔍 Example Prompt (GPT-Compatible)

**Input:**  
_"I’m kind of thinking we could maybe try something like summarizing this, if you think it makes sense."_  

**Directive Output:**  
"Summarize the following text clearly and concisely."

---

## 📦 Use Cases  
- **Prompt Engineering** – Turn exploratory input into solid task directives  
- **AI Assistants** – Help users communicate goals faster  
- **Customer Support Bots** – Clarify user intentions before processing  
- **Creative Tools** – Help artists or writers formulate production-ready input

---

## 🧬 Semantic Origin  
Built for the **System Interface Layer**,  
Directive Translator bridges **natural human uncertainty**  
with the **strict procedural clarity** required by AI systems.

It is a pragmatic bridge module —  
not philosophical, but rooted in purpose-driven language clarity.
