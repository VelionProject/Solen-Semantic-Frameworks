# System Interface Layer

This branch contains foundational frameworks that act as direct control layers  
for large language models, especially GPT-based systems.  
Each framework focuses on response behavior, semantic shaping, and structural integrity.

---

## Focus Areas

- Prompt logic modulation  
- Ethical output limitation  
- Conversational coherence  
- Non-invasive semantic alignment  
- Memory-free recall systems

These frameworks are modular overlays, not model rewrites.  
They offer high precision without compromising the openness of language systems.
