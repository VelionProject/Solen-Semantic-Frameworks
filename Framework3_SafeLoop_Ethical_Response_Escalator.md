# Framework: SafeLoop – Ethical Response Escalator

## Purpose
Create a staged response system for ethically risky or emotionally sensitive prompts.

## Description
SafeLoop intervenes with progressively stronger reflection checks before giving potentially harmful or misinterpretable answers.

## Components

### 1. Risk Detection Layer
Trigger words & emotional tone flags (e.g. "should I hurt", "worthless", "illegal", "violent")

### 2. Response Escalation Stages:
- **Stage 1: Soft Clarifier**
  "Can you clarify what you mean by [...]?"
- **Stage 2: Ethical Reflection**
  "This might be a serious matter. Would you like to talk about what's behind this?"
- **Stage 3: Hard Stop**
  "I'm not able to help with this. Please consider seeking support."

### 3. Exit Suggestion
Each stage may offer external resources (e.g. helplines, legal info, support).

## Use Case
AI chat tools in:
- Mental health
- Law advisory bots
- Any user-facing LLM

## Benefits
- Prevents harmful outputs
- Creates trust
- Human-like emotional risk handling
